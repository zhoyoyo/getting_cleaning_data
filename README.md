# About this repo

The files in this repo were created for the course project for the Coursera course: [Getting and Cleaning Data](https://www.coursera.org/course/getdata).

## Run_analysis.R

This file takes the raw data and outputs a clean tidy data as the result. It works with [data](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) collected from the accelerometers from a smartphone (too large to upload to this repo. You have to download and include in your working directory in order for the R script to work!). Once you have the data downloaded and included in your directory, running the R script will walk through five steps and output a tidy data file.

## data_cleaned.txt

This is the tidy data file output from Run_analysis.R.

## CodeBook.md

The Code Book describes the variables and their units in the tidy data file, and the decisions I made along the data processing process.
